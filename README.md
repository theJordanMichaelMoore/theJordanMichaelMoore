- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @theJordanMichaelMoore
- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about all types of coding. From web developement to Cyber Security. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JAvascript. Once I feel pretty comfortable with those, I want to learn python next.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really! I love to learn and want to know as much as I can!
- How to reach me --> theJordanMichaelMoore@GMAIL.COM. (My portfolio is on here as well so take a look!)
